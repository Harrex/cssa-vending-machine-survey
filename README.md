## Vending Machine Survey
A quick and dirty React app to get some opinions on drinks a couple of vending machines at ANU. 

Features:
- Buttons to vote for individual Drinks
- A text box to add new drink suggestions that can be voted on by others
- Saves votes to local browser cache as JSON
- Displays votes as JSON

- Complete lack of any styling (currently)

It doesn't need to connect to anything else - Everything should run locally on
some form of tablet (Linux/Android probably).
- Should prevent any security risks
